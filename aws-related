What is the difference between a load balancer and a Cloud NAT gateway?

Load Balancer:
Distributes incoming traffic across multiple servers or services.
Primarily used for load distribution, redundancy, and high availability.
Works at various layers (L4 for TCP, L7 for HTTP/HTTPS).

Cloud NAT Gateway:
Provides outbound internet access for instances in a private network without
exposing them to inbound traffic.
Used for secure, private instances that need internet access without being directly
accessible from the internet.
