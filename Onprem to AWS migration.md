Step-by-Step AWS Cloud Migration Process*

1. *Plan the Migration*
Assessment: Identify the current environment (servers, databases, dependencies, and configurations).
Inventory: Document application components and dependencies.
Sizing: Determine AWS resources (EC2 instance types, RDS configurations, etc.) based on current usage.
Network Design: Plan VPC setup, subnets, security groups, and connectivity.
Backup Plan: Create a fallback plan for any issues during migration.

2. *Prepare the AWS Environment*
VPC Setup: Create a VPC with subnets across multiple Availability Zones (AZs).
Security: Configure security groups, IAM roles, and policies.
Database Configuration: Set up an Amazon RDS instance or EC2-based database for the migration.
AD Server: Use AWS Managed Microsoft AD or deploy your AD on EC2.
Application Server: Launch EC2 instances and configure the operating system and required dependencies.

3. *Migrate Database*
Backup: Create a backup of the current database.
Export/Import: Use database migration tools (e.g., AWS DMS or native database tools) to migrate data to the AWS database.
Replication: Set up database replication for real-time sync with the on-prem database.
Validation: Verify data consistency and integrity post-migration.

4. *Migrate Application Server*
Packaging: Package the application (e.g., as Docker containers, AMIs, or simple binaries).
Deployment: Deploy the application on AWS EC2 instances or use AWS Elastic Beanstalk.
DNS Configuration: Update DNS records to point to the AWS environment.

5. *Migrate Active Directory (AD)*
Replication: Create a replica of the on-prem AD in AWS using the AD Trust setup.
DNS Sync: Sync DNS entries between on-prem and AWS environments.
Validation: Test authentication and resource access.

6. *Test and Validate*
End-to-End Testing: Validate the complete environment (application, database, and AD).
Performance Check: Monitor performance using CloudWatch and address any issues.
Failover Testing: Simulate failure scenarios to ensure HA/DR readiness.

7. *Cutover and Go Live*
Schedule Downtime: Coordinate with stakeholders and users for a minimal downtime window.
Final Sync: Perform a final sync of the database and switch traffic to AWS.
DNS Propagation: Update DNS settings to route traffic to the AWS environment (may take up to 24 hours).
Monitoring: Continuously monitor AWS resources and performance post-migration.

8. *Post-Migration Optimization*
Scaling: Implement auto-scaling policies for the application.
Security: Regularly review and improve security configurations.
Cost Optimization: Use AWS Cost Explorer to analyze and optimize resource usage.
Downtime Considerations
Database Migration: Plan a maintenance window of 2â€“4 hours for the final database sync and cutover.
DNS Propagation: Approx. 15 minutes to 24 hours, depending on TTL settings. Use short TTLs during migration to minimize delays.
